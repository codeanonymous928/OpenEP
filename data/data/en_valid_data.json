One Hungarian and two EU officials confirmed media reports that Orbán would meet Russia’s president on Friday. Orbán has seen Putin twice since Russia’s leader ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and has repeatedly held up EU aid for Kyiv and sanctions on Russia. But as Hungary took over the rotating presidency of the EU on Monday, Orbán made a surprise visit to Ukraine, where he spent three hours with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “I think it is his strategy to listen to both parties,” said one person familiar with the matter. Charles Michel, the outgoing president of the European Council which represents EU leaders, posted on X on Thursday that “the EU rotating presidency has no mandate to engage with Russia on behalf of the EU”, adding that “Russia is the aggressor, Ukraine is the victim. No discussions about Ukraine can take place without Ukraine.” Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, did not respond to a request for comment. Peskov declined to confirm or deny reports that Orbán would visit Moscow to Russian state newswires, but promised Putin’s schedule on Friday would be “eventful”. Orbán’s visit would be the first by an EU leader to Moscow since Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer made an unsuccessful effort to broker an end to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in April 2022.

The elections were called by Macron following the European elections, witnessing a voter turnout of 69.7%, the highest since 1986.\n\nThis early result suggests a potential seismic shift in French politics, as Macron, who has been a prominent figure in French politics, particularly after defeating Marine Le Pen in the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections, might have to coexist with a far-right prime minister. This scenario emerged after Macron dissolved the National Assembly on June 9, describing the move as an \"act of trust\" in the French people's judgment and democratic values. The possibility of Jordan Bardella, a 28-year-old close ally of Marine Le Pen, becoming the Prime Minister looms large, which could lead to the far right dominating the National Assembly with an estimated 260 to 310 seats.\n\nReacting to the results, Marine Le Pen celebrated the democratic expression of the French people, claiming a near erasure of Macron's political bloc. Meanwhile, Macron's party, Renaissance, issued a statement urging the public to prevent the far-right from gaining further influence, highlighting the potential risks of economic setbacks and increased taxes under their governance.
