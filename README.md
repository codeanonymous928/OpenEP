# OpenEP

This repository contains the data and code for the paper "OpenEP: Open-Ended Future Event Prediction". OpenEP aims to generate flexible and diverse predictions aligned with real-world scenarios. To facilitate the study of this task, we first construct OpenEPBench, an open-ended future event prediction dataset. Consequently, we propose StkFEP, a stakeholder-enhanced future event prediction framework that incorporates event characteristics for open-ended settings.
